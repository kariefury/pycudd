UNNECESSARY FUNCTIONS
---------------------
Reference counting and manager init and shutdown are all implicitly done:

Cudd_DelayedDerefBdd
Cudd_Deref
Cudd_IterDerefBdd
Cudd_RecursiveDeref
Cudd_RecursiveDerefZdd
Cudd_Ref
Cudd_Init
Cudd_Quit

Hooks are meaningless in this context:
Cudd_RemoveHook
Cudd_StdPostReordHook
Cudd_StdPreReordHook
Cudd_AddHook
Cudd_IsInHook

The following iterator functions have been replaced by being made available directly
as for constructs in Python:

Cudd_ForeachCube
Cudd_ForeachNode
Cudd_ForeachPrime
Cudd_GenFree
Cudd_IsGenEmpty
Cudd_ReadIthClause
Cudd_tlcInfoFree
Cudd_FirstPrime
Cudd_NextPrime

Refer example2.py to see how to use the loops.

UNIMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONS
-----------------------

ZDD iterator functions:

Cudd_zddForeachPath
Cudd_zddCoverPathToString
Cudd_zddFirstPath
Cudd_zddNextPath

ADD functions:

Cudd_addApply
Cudd_addGeneralVectorCompose
Cudd_addLog
Cudd_addMonadicApply
Cudd_addOuterSum

WILL NOT BE IMPLEMENTED UNLESS THE NEED ARISES
----------------------------------------------

No intention of wrapping the following (comments given alongside):

Cudd_PrintTwoLiteralClauses -- Might as well iterate over two-literal and print 'em
Cudd_addHarwell             -- specific benchmark reading routine. Will wrap if ever needed
Cudd_bddRead                -- Don't see a need for these 4 functions.
Cudd_addRead                   If you would like them wrapped/have wrapped them,
Cudd_SubsetWithMaskVars        please get in touch with me at: aravind at engr dot ucsb dot edu
Cudd_SolveEqn                
Cudd_PrioritySelect         -- funky function to pointer ... need to think about it
